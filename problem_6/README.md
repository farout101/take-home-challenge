# Technical Specification: Real-Time Scoreboard Module

---

## 1. System Overview & Core Requirements

This specification outlines the architecture, execution plan, and data contracts for the Real-Time Scoreboard Module. The system is designed to ingest high-frequency user actions, process score increments securely, and broadcast updated rankings to connected clients with sub-second latency.

### System Requirements:

* **Top 10 Global Scoreboard:** Maintain an in-memory sorted cache to serve the top 10 user scores instantly.
* **Real-Time Fan-Out:** Push leaderboard modifications to active clients via a persistent, low-overhead streaming mechanism.
* **Action-Driven Ingestion:** Expose an API endpoint to ingest generic user action events and map them to point values on the server side.
* **High Ingestion Responsiveness:** Decouple the synchronous request ingestion path from downstream cache projection and real-time streaming components.
* **Security & Anti-Cheat Controls:** Enforce token authentication, eliminate client-side score valuation, and implement replay attack mitigations.

## 2. Architectural Topology & Execution Flow

The module implements an **Event-Driven Architecture leveraging the Transactional Outbox Pattern**. This decouples the transactional system of record (PostgreSQL) from the volatile read model (Redis), ensuring data integrity without creating write bottlenecks.

## 3. Interface Contracts (OpenAPI 3.0.1)

The following schema defines the strict API surface area for the scoreboard module. All incoming controllers, request interceptors, and error handlers must adhere directly to this specification.

* OpenAPI spec (YAML): [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml)

## 4. Implementation Details & Execution Plan

This section outlines the actionable workflows the development team will follow to build, test, and integrate the system, ensuring seamless execution from local development to production.

* **Development Workflow:** Work will be executed in agile sprints, isolating feature development. Backend API development, database schema migrations, and frontend integration will run concurrently, strictly adhering to the API contracts defined above.
* **Local Containerization:** Utilize Docker to spin up local environments containing the application, PostgreSQL, and Redis. This ensures environment consistency across the team and eliminates integration discrepancies.
* **Version Control & CI/CD Pipelines:** The team will enforce a strict Git branching strategy for all new features. All pull requests must pass peer review and trigger the CI/CD pipelines to streamline backend delivery. Automated unit and integration tests must pass before any code is merged into the main branch.

## 5. Deployment Plan & Rollout Strategy

This section defines the infrastructure strategy and the step-by-step process for safely transitioning the application into live environments.

* **Cloud Infrastructure:** The system will utilize a distributed design with AWS, provisioned via Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to guarantee repeatable and identical environment setups across Development, Staging, and Production.
* **Container Orchestration:** The backend module will utilize Kubernetes deployments. This allows for automated scaling of the application pods to handle high-frequency ingestion spikes and maintains high availability for the real-time SSE connections.
* **Deployment Methodology:** The transition to production will execute via a Rolling Update strategy within the Kubernetes cluster, guaranteeing zero downtime. The load balancer will only route live traffic to newly deployed pods once they pass all automated readiness and liveness health checks.
* **Monitoring & Automated Rollback:** System metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, Redis latency, and API error rates) will be actively monitored. If error thresholds are exceeded during a rollout, the CI/CD pipeline will automatically trigger a rollback to the last stable release.

## 6. Architectural Rationale & Technical Trade-offs

### Transactional Outbox vs. Immediate Cache Writes

Writing directly to a database and a cache sequentially within an identical application thread presents a critical failure mode: if the cache layer experiences a transient network drop after the database commit, the read and write models diverge indefinitely. By executing the business state mutation and appending an event log entry to an `outbox_events` table within a single atomic ACID transaction, eventual consistency between PostgreSQL and Redis is structurally guaranteed.

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) vs. WebSockets

WebSockets introduce a full-duplex communication channel over a persistent TCP connection, requiring complex state management, custom heartbeat framing, and high memory overhead per node. Because the leaderboard interface only requires unidirectional server-to-client streaming, Server-Sent Events (SSE) was selected. SSE operates natively over standard HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, utilizes standard text streaming protocols, and delegates reconnection logic entirely to the browser's native capabilities.

### Redis Pub/Sub for Horizontal Scalability

In a horizontally scaled application cluster, clients are distributed across multiple independent application nodes. When a node processes a score modification, it must notify clients connected to all other nodes. Utilizing a central Redis Pub/Sub topology allows application nodes to subscribe to a unified event backbone, executing message fan-out to locally held client connection pools seamlessly.

## 7. System Benefits & Quality Attributes

* **Zero-Trust Ingestion:** The client payload contains zero information regarding numerical point adjustments. The client submits a verifiable action identifier; the server maps the token against an internal config dictionary to dictate score deltas, nullifying payload tampering vectors.
* **System Resilience:** If the Redis speed layer faces an outage, the PostgreSQL transaction log remains unaffected. Once the cache recovers, the outbox worker automatically drains the pending transaction backlog, establishing a self-healing operational boundary.
* **Predictable Database I/O:** Client ranking lookups and Top 10 lists bypass relational database indexing entirely, executing against an in-memory structure bounded at $O(\log N)$ complexity.
